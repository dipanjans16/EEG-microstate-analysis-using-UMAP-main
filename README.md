# EEG-microstate-analysis-using-UMAP

This project uses UMAP to extract microstates. To understand about EEG microstates and the data that has been used please refer to this research paper-https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79423-7

All datasets presented in this study are openly available in PhysioNet at https://doi.org/10.13026/C2JQ1P. All epochs that have been preprocessed are available on Figshare at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13135130.

In this project I would like to thank Frederic-vW for provind basic function to extract microstates in the source file https://github.com/Frederic-vW/eeg_microstates
. Some of them has been used in this project.
